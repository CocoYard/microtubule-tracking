# Microtubules Tracking
#Readme
1. Create a python 3.8 environment and install all the required packages: Napari, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, and shapely.
2. Just click run.
3. Use the Napari built-in button to add shape, choose the line shape and draw it on the microtubule you want to track on the first frame, and click "Calculate".
4. If you want to use the darken function, use the Napari built-in button to add a shape, choose the polygon shape, draw it on the area you want to darken, and then click "Darken". It usually takes about 30s seconds to compute. After it is finished, remember to change the image layer to "darken" before clicking "Calculate".
